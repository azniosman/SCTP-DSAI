# Assignment

## Brief

This assignment will apply your Python knowledge to solve a few problems and understanding of git commands to commit and push the solutions to Github.

## Instructions

1. Fork this repository to your own Github account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new conda environment.
4. Freeze the dependencies of the environment to a file called `environment.yml`.
