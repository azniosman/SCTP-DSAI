# Self Studies

## Brief

In this lesson, we will kick start the journey of Python data science stack by introducing `Jupyter Notebook` and `Numpy` library. Jupyter Notebook is a web-based interactive development environment for creating and sharing documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Numpy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
